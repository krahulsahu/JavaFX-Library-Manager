# ShelfMate â€” JavaFX Library Manager

- Display a list of books in a TableView with columns: Book ID, Title, Author, Available (boolean).
- Insert a new book with title, author and availability.
- Update an existing book by selecting a row and editing its fields.
- Delete a selected book from the list.
- Search books by title (case-insensitive) and display matching results.
- Refresh the table to show the latest data source contents.
- Sort the visible books by title (case-insensitive).
- Uses JDBC to persist data to a MySQL `Books` table when available.
- Falls back to a seeded in-memory dataset when the database is unreachable so the UI and tests remain functional.
- Pre-seeds the app with sample books (e.g., "1984", "The Great Gatsby") when starting with an empty database or when running without DB.
